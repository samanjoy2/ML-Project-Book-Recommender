# ML-Project-Book-Recommender

## Basics

This Machine Learning project is a Book Recommendation System.
A working prototype made by Streamlit can be found here: https://mlproject-books-recommender.herokuapp.com/

## Project Description

After a user selects a book of their preference, the system recommends 5 books that are similar to that selected books.

How the system selects the similar books:
- All the books informations are converted as tags and those tags are then converted into vectors. These vectors help us to find the similar books as only sorting through them gives us the most similar books.
- The .ipynb file has all the information on how it fully works.

The website is deployed using streamlit library which uses the pickled files for data uses.
